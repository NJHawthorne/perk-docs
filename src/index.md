## Perk is an exceptionally well <u>[documented](/api.html)</u> set of tools for building node web applications.

The goal of Perk was to allow you to get up and running with minimal effort, while still providing you the flexibility to build production ready node apps. With these goals in mind, Perk is built on top of [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [Redis](http://redis.io/), and [Knex](http://knexjs.org/) and doesn't try to hide it. This provides node newbies with a sane set of default tools while still giving more seasoned developers the opportunity to switch out a library here or there if they choose.
