Before we can start writing code we need to install a few other things that Perk depends on. Those things are **node** and **redis**. The easiest way to do this on OS X is by using **homebrew**. Sorry for all the names! I wish I could say is gets better, but it doesn't.

There are instructions for how to [install Homebrew here](http://brew.sh/). Basically you just need to open up your terminal and copy and paste the command under the big **Install Homebrew** heading. Once you're done installing homebrew, meet us back here. We'll be waiting.

> Normally you don't want to paste random commands from the internet into your terminal because bad people can do bad things, but homebrew is very trusted in the development community and you can see exactly what the script does [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Installation.md#installation).
