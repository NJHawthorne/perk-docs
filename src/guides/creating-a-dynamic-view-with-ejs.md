<!--
*ejs* templating supports the following tags:

* `<% ... %>` - anything inside of this tag will be evaluated as JavaScript code.

	> eg. `<% var message = 'ejs is <strong>cool</strong>' %>`

* `<%= ... %>` - anything inside of this tag will be evaluated as JavaScript code and escaped before being inserted into the page.

	> eg. `<h1><%= message %></h1>` will render `<h1>ejs is &lt;strong&gt;cool&lt;/strong&gt;</h1>`

* `<%- ... %>` - anything inside of this tag will be evaluated as JavaScript code and inserted into the page without being escaped.

	> eg. `<span><%= message %></span>` will render `<span>ejs is <strong>cool</strong></span>`
